## üìå Notes

- Ensure both the **MLX90614** and **BMP280** sensors use I2C communication (check breakout board specs).
- **Pull-up resistors (10kŒ©)** might be necessary for I2C lines (SDA and SCL) depending on sensor configuration.
- Each **LED** should be connected in series with a **220Œ© resistor** to limit current and prevent damage.
- The **buzzer** can be used for sound notifications triggered by sensor thresholds or events.
